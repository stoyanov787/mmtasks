# MMSolutions Tasks

This repository contains two C utilities: Extract Maximum and Maximum Slope Dynamic Range.

## Quick Start

### Ex_5: Extract Maximum
Finds the maximum value in an array and copies elements surrounding that maximum.

```bash
cd Ex_5
./run.sh  # Compiles and runs tests
```

### Ex_6: Maximum Slope Dynamic Range
Calculates the maximum slope between adjacent points and determines the dynamic range around it.

```bash
cd Ex_6
./run.sh  # Compiles and runs tests
```

## Key Features

- **Extract Maximum**: Copies 5 elements around maximum value
- **Max Slope Dynamic Range**: Finds steepest slope and calculates ratio in fixed-point (8 fractional bits)

## Requirements

- GCC compiler
- Standard C libraries

Run individual test cases to see example input/output behaviors.
